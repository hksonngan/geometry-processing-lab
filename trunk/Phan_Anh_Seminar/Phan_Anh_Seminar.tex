\section{Image Features}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Image Feature Overview}
%What are image features? How can we describe/represent them?
Low level image features are essential building blocks for high level image processing tasks such as object detection, image categorization or segmentation etc. In general, image features capture important properties around local image regions in the form of high dimensional feature vectors that can be used by high level applications. Normally, raw features are extracted at each pixel by applying various kinds of filters. Each filter response contributes one dimension in the feature vector space. The shape and size of filters reflect local structure around each pixel. Raw features at each pixel can be collected to form region descriptors which can be used to represent shapes, contours etc. In this section we present methods to extract raw features and various ways of constructing region descriptors. Specifically, Section $\ref{sec:surf}$ describes a state-of-the-art feature named SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) \cite{bay2006surf} and Section $\ref{sec:shape_feature}$ explains the gPb (globalized probability of boundary) contour extractor \cite{maire2008using}.

\subsection{SURF Feature}
\label{sec:surf}
SURF \cite{bay2006surf} was originally developed for the task of finding point correspondences between two images of the same scene. This includes three main steps. First, "interest points" are
selected at distinctive locations in the image. Then a feature vector is extracted from the neighbourhood of every interest point. Finally the feature vectors are matched between different images. Since the SURF descriptor provides a very good representation of a local region it has been applied to other tasks such as image classification or image segmentation.

Regarding the interest point detection problem, the choice of the detector varies depending on the application need. In an image registration application, it is required that the same interest points be detected in two different images of the same scene under different viewing conditions. In this case, the good detector would pick up corner points. In the case of image segmentation, it would be a wise choice to select points on contours to be interest points. In the original SURF paper, Bay et al. suggested using approximate Hessian detector to search in scale-space domain for points having strong derivatives in two orthogonal directions as interest points (often located at corners and strongly textured areas).

Given an interest point in the input image, the SURF descriptor is obtained by extracting distinctive information around its neighbourhood in a form of a feature vector. The SURF descriptor is designed to be invariant to image scaling and rotation while it has to be computed very fast. Scale invariance is achieved by adopting the scale at which the Hessian detector attains maximal response. In order to be invariant to rotation, we first find a reproducible orientation based on information within a circular region around the interest point. We then construct a square region aligned to the selected orientation and extract the SURF descriptor from it.

To find the dominant orientation, the Haar wavelet responses in $x$ and $y$ directions, ($d_x$, $d_y$), are calculated within a circular neighbourhood of radius $6s$ around the interest point and weighted with a Gaussian ($\sigma = 2s$), where $s$ is the scale chosen above. Figure $\ref{fig:haar_wavelet}$ shows the structure of the Haar wavelet filters. The wavelet responses ($d_x, d_y$) are then represented in a vector space and the sum of all vectors within a sliding orientation window of size $\pi/3$ are calculated, see Figure $\ref{fig:orientation_window}$. The dominant orientation is finally assigned to the sum vector having the maximal length.

    \caption{(a) Haar wavelet filters for the x (left) and y (right) components. The dark parts are weighted -1 and the light parts +1. (b) Orientation assignment: a sliding orientation window of size $\pi/3$ detects the dominant orientation. (c) The SURF descriptor: an oriented quadratic grid with $4 \times 4$ square cells is laid over the interest point (left). For each cell, the wavelet responses are computed from $5 \times 5$ samples (for illustrative
    purposes, only $2 \times 2$ sub-divisions are shown here). In each cell, the 4 elements $\sum d_x$, $\sum \left| d_x \right|$, $\sum d_y$, $\sum \left| d_y \right| $ contribute to the SURF feature vector. } 
    %\label{fig:surf}
\end{figure}

To extract the SURF descriptor, we construct a window of size $20s$ centred at the interest point and oriented in the dominant orientation as illustrated in Figure $\ref{fig:surf}$. The window is then subdivided into a regular $4 \times 4$ grid cells, each being a $5 \times 5$ pixel patch. For each cell, the Gaussian weighted ($\sigma = 3.3s$) Haar wavelet responses are summed up to form a first set of entries in the feature vector. The sum of the absolute values of the responses, $\left| d_x \right| $ and $\left| d_y \right| $ are also extracted to capture information about the polarity of the intensity changes. Therefore, each cell has a 4D descriptor vector for its underlying intensity structure $\left( \sum d_x, \sum d_y, \sum \left| d_x \right| , \sum \left| d_y \right|  \right)$. Concatenating this for all $4 \times 4$ cells results in a descriptor vector of length 64. Finally the descriptor vector is normalized to make it invariant to contrast.

\subsection{gPb Contour Extractor}
\label{sec:shape_feature}

introduction to gPb

\subsubsection{Gradient-Based Features}

The gradient-based paradigm was used by Martin et al. in their $Pb$ paper \cite{martin2004learning} to detect local changes in color, texture and brightness. Basically at each pixel location $(x, y)$, a circle of radius $r$ is drawn and cut half along the diameter having orientation $\theta$. The gradient function $G(x, y, \theta, r)$ is used to compare the contents of the two resulting half disks. An edge is detected if there is a large difference between the two half disks along the chosen orientation.

To represent the color and brightness contents within a half disk, histograms are built by sampling the Gaussian kernel density estimates of brightness and color in CIELAB color space. The L* channel is used to compute brightness histogram and the a* and b* are used to compute color histogram. The bin size is chosen such that each bin contains at least 2 Gaussian kernels of size $2\sigma$. Figure $\ref{fig:kde}$ shows an example of a Gaussian kernel density estimate. The $\chi^2$ distance is used to compute the difference between histograms:
\begin{equation}
	\chi^2(g, h) = 1/2\sum \dfrac{(g_i - h_i)^2}{g_i + h_i}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \subfigure[]
    {
        \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{images/kde.png}
        \label{fig:kde}
    }
    \subfigure[]
    {
        \includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{images/filter_bank.png}
        \label{fig:filter_bank}
    }
    \subfigure[]
    {
        \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{images/textons.png}
        \label{fig:textons}
    }
    \subfigure[]
    {
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/texture_map.png}
        \label{fig:texture_map}
    }
    \caption{  } 
    %\label{fig:texture}
\end{figure}

Considering the problem of computing texture gradient, a group of 13 filters covering the most probable shapes is used. Particularly, it consists of six pairs of elongated, oriented filters and a center-surround filter as shown in Figure $\ref{fig:filter_bank}$. The oriented filters are in even/odd quadrature pairs. The even symmetric filter is a Gaussian second derivative, and the odd-symmetric filter is its Hilbert transform. Finally, a difference of Gaussians is chosen to be the center-surround filter. This filter bank generates a feature vector of 13 dimensions corresponding to 13 filter responses at each pixel.

In order to build up histograms for comparison, the $Pb$ algorithm uses the so called textons approach (or bag of textures approach) introduced by Malik et al. \cite{malik2001contour}. The basic idea is to cluster the filter response vectors over a large, diverse collection of training images using k-means. Each cluster defines a Voronoi cell in the space of joint filter responses, and the cluster centers, textons, represent texture primitives. Figure $\ref{fig:textons}$ illustrates example textons for k = 64 computed over the 200 images in the training set. Once the dictionary of textons have been computed, each pixel is assigned to the nearest texton. Figure $\ref{fig:texture_map}$ shows an image and the associated texton map, where each pixel has been labeled with the nearest texton. Finally the histograms of activated textons in the two disc halves can be computed and compared using the $\chi^2$ distance operator.

\subsubsection{gPb Feature}

\cite{maire2008using}

The gPb contour detector is an extension of Pb contour detector into which global information is integrated via spectral graph theory. Particularly, the gPb algorithm follows the idea of the normalized cut algorithm which finds the generalized eigenvectors of the linear system involving an affinity matrix whose entries encode the similarity between pixels. Section $\ref{sec:normalized_cut}$ will explain the normalized cut algorithm in more detail.
