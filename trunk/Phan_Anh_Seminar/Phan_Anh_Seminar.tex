\section{Image Features}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Image Feature Overview}
%What are image features? How can we describe/represent them?
Low level image features are essential building blocks for high level image processing tasks such as object detection, image categorization or segmentation. In general, image features capture important properties around local image regions in the form of high dimensional feature vectors that can be used by high level applications. Normally, raw features are extracted at each pixel by applying various kinds of filters. Each filter response contributes one dimension in the feature vector space. The shape and size of filters reflect local structure around each pixel. Raw features at each pixel can be collected to form region descriptors which can be used to represent shapes, contours etc. In this section we present methods to extract raw features and various ways of constructing region descriptors. Specifically, Section $\ref{sec:surf}$ describes a state-of-the-art feature named Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) \cite{bay2006surf} and Section $\ref{sec:shape_feature}$ explains the globalized probability of boundary (gPb) contour extractor \cite{maire2008using}.

\subsection{Speeded Up Robust Features}
\label{sec:surf}
Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) \cite{bay2006surf} was originally developed for the task of finding point correspondences between two images of the same scene. This includes three main steps. First, interest points are selected at distinctive locations in the image. Then a feature vector is extracted from the neighbourhood of every interest point. Finally the feature vectors are matched between different images. Since the SURF descriptor provides a very good representation of a local region it has been applied to tasks other than correspondence problem such as image classification or image segmentation.

Regarding the interest point detection problem, the choice of the detector varies depending on the application need. In an image registration application, it is required that the same interest points be detected in two different images of the same scene under different viewing conditions. In this case, the good detector would pick up hard-to-miss points which present in both images such as blobs or corner points. In the case of image segmentation, it would be a wise choice to select points on contours to be interest points. In the original SURF paper, Bay et al. suggested using approximate Hessian detector to search in scale-space domain for points having strong derivatives in two orthogonal directions as interest points (often located at corners and strongly textured areas).

Given an interest point in the input image, the SURF descriptor is obtained by extracting distinctive information around its neighbourhood in a form of a feature vector. The SURF descriptor is designed to be invariant to image scaling and rotation while it can be computed very fast. Scale invariance is achieved by adopting the scale at which the Hessian detector attains maximal response. In order to be invariant to rotation, we first find a reproducible orientation based on information within a circular region around the interest point. We then construct a square region aligned to the selected orientation and extract the SURF descriptor from it.

To find the dominant orientation, Haar wavelet responses in $x$ and $y$ directions ($d_x$, $d_y$) are calculated within a circular neighbourhood of radius $6s$ around the interest point and weighted with a Gaussian ($\sigma = 2s$), where $s$ is the scale chosen above. Figure $\ref{fig:haar_wavelet}$ shows the structure of the Haar wavelet filters. The wavelet responses ($d_x, d_y$) are then represented in a vector space and the sum of all vectors within a sliding orientation window of size $\frac{\pi}{3}$ is calculated, see Figure $\ref{fig:orientation_window}$. The dominant orientation is finally assigned to the sum vector having the maximal length.

    \caption{(a) Haar wavelet filters for the x (left) and y (right) components. The dark parts are weighted -1 and the light parts +1. (b) Orientation assignment: a sliding orientation window of size $\pi/3$ detects the dominant orientation. (c) The SURF descriptor: an oriented quadratic grid with $4 \times 4$ square cells is laid over the interest point (left). For each cell, the wavelet responses are computed from $5 \times 5$ samples (for illustrative purposes, only $2 \times 2$ sub-divisions are shown here). In each cell, the 4 elements $\sum d_x$, $\sum \left| d_x \right|$, $\sum d_y$, $\sum \left| d_y \right| $ contribute to the SURF feature vector. The images are taken from \cite{bay2006surf}.} 
    %\label{fig:surf}
\end{figure}

To extract the SURF descriptor, we construct a window of size $20s$ centred at the interest point and oriented in the dominant orientation as illustrated in Figure $\ref{fig:surf}$. The window is then subdivided into regular $4 \times 4$ grid cells, each being a $5 \times 5$ pixel patch. For each cell, the Gaussian weighted ($\sigma = 3.3s$) Haar wavelet responses are summed up to form a first set of entries in the feature vector. The sum of the absolute values of the responses, $\left| d_x \right| $ and $\left| d_y \right| $ are also extracted to capture information about the polarity of the intensity changes. Therefore, each cell has a 4D descriptor vector for its underlying intensity structure $\left( \sum d_x, \sum d_y, \sum \left| d_x \right| , \sum \left| d_y \right|  \right)$. Concatenating this for all $4 \times 4$ cells results in a descriptor vector of length 64. Finally the descriptor vector is normalized to make it invariant to contrast.

\subsection{Globalized Probability of Boundary Contour Extractor}
\label{sec:shape_feature}

Globalized probability of boundary (gPb) contour extractor was developed based on the predecessor, namely probability of boundary (Pb), which uses features extracted from a local image patch to estimate the posterior probability of a boundary passing through the current pixel. gPb improves from Pb by introducing global information based on spectral graph theory. In this Section, we will first survey the local features used by Pb. We will then explain how gPb incorporates global information into Pb. Finally, we will show one method to extract shape descriptors from regions defined by gPb contours. The method to estimate the posterior probability of a boundary will be explained in more detail in Section $\ref{sec:logistic_regression}$.

\subsubsection{Gradient-Based Features}
\label{sec:textons}

The gradient-based paradigm was used by Martin et al. in their $Pb$ paper \cite{martin2004learning} to detect local changes in color, texture and brightness. Basically at each pixel location $(x, y)$, a circle of radius $r$ is drawn and cut half along the diameter having orientation $\theta$. The gradient function $G(x, y, \theta, r)$ is used to compare the contents of the two resulting half disks. An edge is detected if there is a large difference between the two half disks along the chosen orientation.

To represent the color and brightness contents within a half disk, histograms are built by sampling the Gaussian kernel density estimates of brightness and color in CIELAB color space. The L* channel is used to compute brightness histogram and the a* and b* are used to compute color histogram. The bin size is chosen such that each bin contains at least 2 Gaussian kernels of size $2\sigma$. Figure $\ref{fig:kde}$ shows an example of a Gaussian kernel density estimate. The $\chi^2$ distance is used to compute the difference between histograms:
\begin{equation}
	\chi^2(g, h) = \frac{1}{2} \sum \dfrac{(g_i - h_i)^2}{g_i + h_i}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    }
    \caption{ (a) Kernel density estimate constructed using 6 data points.

(d) Texton Map: An image and its associated texton map. The images in Figrures b-d are taken from \cite{martin2004learning}.} 
    %\label{fig:texture}
\end{figure}

Considering the problem of computing texture gradient, a group of 13 filters covering the most probable shapes is used. Particularly, it consists of six pairs of elongated, oriented filters and a center-surround filter as shown in Figure $\ref{fig:filter_bank}$. The oriented filters are in even/odd quadrature pairs. The even symmetric filter is a Gaussian second derivative, and the odd-symmetric filter is its Hilbert transform. Finally, a difference of Gaussians is chosen to be the center-surround filter. This filter bank generates a feature vector of 13 dimensions corresponding to 13 filter responses at each pixel.

In order to build up histograms for comparison, the $Pb$ algorithm uses the so called textons approach (or bag-of-textures approach) introduced by Malik et al. \cite{malik2001contour}. The basic idea is to cluster the filter response vectors over a large, diverse collection of training images using k-means. Each cluster defines a Voronoi cell in the space of joint filter responses, and the cluster centers, textons, represent texture primitives. Figure $\ref{fig:textons}$ illustrates example textons for k = 64 computed over the 200 images in the training set. Once the dictionary of textons has been computed, each pixel is assigned to the nearest texton. Figure $\ref{fig:texture_map}$ shows an image and the associated texton map, where each pixel has been labeled with the nearest texton. Finally the histograms of activated textons in the two disc halves can be computed and compared using the $\chi^2$ distance operator.

\subsubsection{gPb Feature}

The gPb contour detector \cite{maire2008using} is an extension of the Pb contour detector into which global information is integrated via spectral graph theory. Particularly, the gPb algorithm follows the idea of the normalized cut algorithm which defines an affinity matrix $W$ whose entries encode the similarity between pixels. The generalized eigenvectors of the following linear system provide global segmentation information:
\begin{equation}
(D-W)\mathbf{v} = \lambda D \mathbf{v}
\label{eq:ncut}
\end{equation}
where $D$ is diagonal matrix with $D_{ii} = \sum_j W_{ij}$.
Section $\ref{sec:normalized_cut}$ will explain the normalized cut algorithm in more detail.

We start by extracting the brightness, color and texture gradients in 3 different scales: $[\sigma/2, \sigma, 2\sigma]$, where $\sigma$ is the default scale of the Pb detector. This gives 9 different responses ${G_i}$. These local cues are then linearly combined into a single multiscale oriented signal:

\begin{equation}
mPb(x, y, \theta) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{9}G_i(x, y, \theta)
\end{equation}

In order to integrate global information, the affinity matrix $W$ is constructed by using the intervening contour cue \cite{leung1998contour}, that is, its entries are the maximal values of $mPb$ along a line connecting two pixels as shown in Figure $\ref{fig:intervening_contour}$. The first $k + 1$ generalized eigenvectors $\mathbf{v_j}$ of the system $\ref{eq:ncut}$ are chosen and reshaped in the size of the original image. Contours are extracted from each eigenvector $\mathbf{v_j}$ by applying Gaussian directional derivatives at multiple orientations $\theta$, resulting in an oriented signal $sPb_{\mathbf{v_j}}(x, y, \theta)$. The information from different eigenvectors is then combined to provide the "spectral" boundary detector:

\begin{equation}
sPb(x, y, \theta) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{k}\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda_j}}sPb_{\mathbf{v_j}}(x, y, \theta)
\end{equation}

where $0 = \lambda_0 \leq ... \leq \lambda_k$ are corresponding eigenvalues. Figure $\ref{fig:sPb}$ illustrates an example of the spectral boundary detector $sPb$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \subfigure[]
    {
    	\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{images/intervening_contour.png}
        \label{fig:intervening_contour}
    }
    \subfigure[]
    {
    	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/sPb.png}
        \label{fig:sPb}
    }
    \caption{(a) Example of an intervening contour. Above is an image patch in which the intensity values at pixels $p_1, p_2$ and $p_3$ are similar. However, there is an edge in the middle suggesting that $p_1$ and $p_2$ belong to the same group while $p_3$ belongs to a different group. Below is the image computed by using the orientation energy \cite{leung1998contour}. The orientation energy somewhere on $l_2$ is strong which correctly proposes that $p_1$ and $p_3$ belong to two different partitions. (b) Top: Original image and first four generalized eigenvectors. Bottom: Maximum response over orientations $\theta$ of $sPb(x, y, \theta)$ and of $sPb_{\mathbf{v_j}}(x, y, \theta)$ for each eigenvector $\mathbf{v_j}$.}
\end{figure}

Finally, the globalized probability of boundary , i.e. gPb, is then defined as:

\begin{equation}
gPb(x, y, \theta) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{9}\beta_i G_i(x, y, \theta) + \gamma sPb(x, y, \theta)
\end{equation}

where the weights are learned by gradient ascent on the F-measure = $2\cdot Precision \cdot Recall/(Precision + Recall)$.

\subsubsection{Shape Descriptor}

The contours detected above define over-segmented regions of the image. Gu et al. \cite{gu2009recognition} proposed a way to describe a region by subdividing evenly its bounding box into an $n \times n$ grid. The grid size n = 4 seems to be appropriate. Each cell encodes information only inside the region. Different cues are extracted from each cell, and each type of cue is encoded by concatenating cell signals into a histogram. The following region cues are included:

\begin{itemize}
\item Contour shape, given by the histogram of oriented responses of the contour detector gPb.
\item Edge shape, computed by convolution with a [-1 0 1] filter along x and y axes. This captures high frequency information, while it has been smoothed out by gPb.
\item Color, represented by the L*, a and b histograms in the CIELAB color space.
\item Texture, described by texton histograms.
\end{itemize}

There are some advantages of this representation which were pointed out by Gu et al. Firstly, the scale invariant nature of region descriptors enables us to compare regions regardless of their relative sizes. Secondly, background clutter interferes with region representations only mildly compared to interest point descriptors.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Discussion}

So far we have seen many ways to extract features from an image, each has its own primary purpose. SURF feature was originally developed for the problem of image matching but it is also suitable for compact representation of local, isotropic image patches. The advantage of using SURF for object detection is due to its local nature, thereby being invariant to great viewpoint change and having the capability of detecting deformable objects \cite{VijayGrauman2011}. gPb, however, was developed to detect contours hence suitable for the segmentation tasks \cite{arbelaez2009contours} \cite{gu2009recognition}. It can also be used to detect objects with parts defined by their shape \cite{VijayGrauman2011} \cite{gu2009recognition}.

\section{Supervised Learning Segmentation}

\subsection{Support Vector Machine}
\label{sec:svm}

Support vector machine (SVM) invented by Cortes and Vapnik \cite{cortes1995support} is a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier which predicts, for each input data point, which of the two possible classes the input belongs. SVM maximizes the margin between positive and negative data points (as shown in Figure $\ref{fig:svm}$), thereby achieving very good generalization performance.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \subfigure[]
    {
    	\includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth]{images/svm.png}
        \label{fig:svm}
    }
    \caption{Linear separating hyperplanes for the separable case. The support vectors are circled.}
\end{figure}

In this paper we only consider the case of linearly separable data. Let's $\left\lbrace (\mathbf{x_i}, t_i)\right\rbrace _{i=1}^N, \mathbf{x_i} \in R^d$ be $N$ training data points with the corresponding target values $t_i \in \left\lbrace -1, 1\right\rbrace $. Our goal is to find a hyperplane of the form $\mathbf{w^T x} + b = 0$ which separates the data with maximal margin. The margin is formulated by defining $d_+$ and $d_-$ to be the distances to the nearest positive and negative training examples respectively. We can always scale $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$ such that $d_- = d_+ = \dfrac{1}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}$. Since the data is linearly separable, there exists a
hyperplane with:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{lcl}
	\mathbf{w^T x_i} + b \geq +1\ for\ t_i = +1\\
	\mathbf{w^T x_i} + b \leq -1\ for\ t_i = -1
	\end{array}
\end{equation}

Combined in one equation, this can be written as:
\begin{equation}
t_i(\mathbf{w^T x_i} + b) \geq 1\ \forall i
\label{eq:margin}
\end{equation}

The equality in Equation $\ref{eq:margin}$ will hold exactly for the points on the margin. In order to maximize the margin $M = d_- + d_+ = \dfrac{2}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}$, we need to minimize $\|\mathbf{w}\|$. This can be formally stated as the following optimization problem: find the hyperplane satisfying

\begin{equation}
\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\mathbf{w}, b} \dfrac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{w}\|^2
\end{equation}

subject to the constraint in equation $\ref{eq:margin}$. This quadratic programming problem with linear constraints can be solved efficiently using Lagrange multipliers. Particularly, if we introduce positive Lagrange multipliers $a_i \geq 0\ \forall i$ then the above constrained optimization problem boils down to the problem of minimizing the primal form of the following Lagrangian:

\begin{equation}
L_p(\mathbf{w}, b, \mathbf{a}) = \dfrac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 - \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N}a_i\left( t_i(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x_i} + b) - 1 \right) 
\end{equation}

By taking the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to $w$ and set it to zero, i.e. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = 0$, we get the solution for $\mathbf{w}$ which is nothing more than a linear combination of training examples:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{w} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N} a_i t_i x_i
\end{equation}

Note that $a_i > 0$ only for training data points on the margin called support vectors. We get the solution for $b$ by observing that any support vector $x_j$ satisfies the equality condition in Equation $\ref{eq:margin}$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
t_j \left( \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N} a_i t_i x_i^t x_j + b \right) = 1\\
b = t_j - \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N} a_i t_i x_i^t x_j
\end{array}
\end{equation}

In practice, it is more robust to average the solution for $b$ over all support vectors. The primal form of the Lagrangian $L_p$ can be transformed into the dual form to avoid the dependency on the dimensionality. This makes it possible to work with infinite-dimensional feature spaces by using some kernel tricks. More detail on extensions to the case of non-separable data as well as non-linear support vector machines can be found in \cite{burges1998tutorial}.

%\subsubsection{Structured SVM learning framework}

%\cite{tsochantaridis2006large}

\subsubsection{SVM for region ranking}

In this section we will formulate a SVM classifier in a way that it can reliably score a region of arbitrary shape according to how strongly it belongs to a particular object category. It is desirable that features extracted from local image regions can be combined additively to obtain the classifier response for a larger region. It has been proven \cite{lampert2008beyond} that a linear kernel SVM applied to a bag-of-features representation (recall the concept of bag-of-textures from Section $\ref{fig:textons}$) has this additive property. Similar to the textons approach, we obtain a vocabulary of K visual words by clustering a sample of local features (e.g. SURF) from the training images. We represent a region by its set of local features $R = \left\lbrace (x_i, v_i) \right\rbrace _{i=1} ^ N$, where $x_i$ being the feature position and $v_i$ the local descriptor. A histogram can be built from this bag-of-features, denoted $h(R)$, by mapping each feature $v_i$ to its closest visual word $c_i$ and recording the frequency of words in a K-dimensional vector.

A linear SVM classifier is learned from the segmented training examples according to the principle described in Section $\ref{sec:svm}$. The region ranking score is then given as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:svm_classifier}
\begin{array}{lcl}
f(R) & = & b + w \cdot h(R)\\
f(R) & = & b + \sum_{i}a_i t_i h(R_i) \cdot h(R)\\
f(R) & = & b + \sum_{i}\alpha_i h(R_i) \cdot h(R)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

where $b$ and $\alpha_i = a_i t_i$ denote the learned weights and bias. Since the Equation $\ref{eq:svm_classifier}$ only involves linear operations, we can rearrange the terms to express $f(R)$ as a sum over per-feature contributions. Let $h_j(R)$ be the count in the $j$-th bin of the region histogram $h(R)$. We associate each $j$-word in the vocabulary with a weight $w_j$: $w_j = \sum_i \alpha_i h_j(R_i)$. Therefore, the classifier response for a region can be rewritten as:

\begin{equation}
f(R) = b + \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{K} w_j h_j(R) = b + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N}w_{c_i}
\end{equation}

where $c_i$ is the index of the visual word that feature $v_i$ maps to, $c_i \in [1, K]$. This means the score of a region is the sum of its N features' word weights. Since we are only interested in maximizing the classifier response $f(R)$, the bias term $b$ is irrelevant and can be ignored.

\subsection{Logistic Regression}

\label{sec:logistic_regression}

In the problem of two-class classification, the logistic regression method models the posterior probability of class $C_1$ by applying a logistic sigmoid function $\sigma$ on a linear discriminant function of the feature vector $\phi$ so that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:logistic}
p(C_1|\phi) = y(\phi) = \sigma(w^T\phi)
\end{equation}

with $p(C_2|\phi) = 1 - p(C_1|\phi)$. The logistic sigmoid function $\sigma$ is derived from the Bayes decision theory as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bayes}
\begin{array}{lcl}
p(C_1|x) & = & \dfrac{p(x|C_1)p(C_1)}{p(x|C_1)p(C_1) + p(x|C_2)p(C_2)}\\
		 & = & \dfrac{1}{1 + \dfrac{p(x|C_2)p(C_2)}{p(x|C_1)p(C_1)}}\\
		 & = & \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-a}} \equiv \sigma(a)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

with $a = \ln \dfrac{p(x|C_1)p(C_1)}{p(x|C_2)p(C_2)} = \ln(p(C_1|x) - p(C_2|x))$ represents the decision boundary corresponding to the decision boundary $w^T\phi$ in Equation $\ref{eq:logistic}$. The advantage of using Equation $\ref{eq:logistic}$ as opposed to Equation $\ref{eq:Bayes}$ is to avoid density estimation for all of its factors.

Suppose we have a training data set $\left\lbrace \phi_n, t_n \right\rbrace$ with $n = 1, ... N$, where $\phi_n = \phi(x_n)$ and $t_n \in \left\lbrace 0, 1 \right\rbrace$, $t = (t_1, ..., t_n)^T$. With $y_n = p(C_1|\phi_n)$, we can write the likelihood as:

\begin{equation}
p(t|w) = \prod\limits_{n = 1}^{N}y_n^{t_n} (1 - y_n)^{1 - t_n}
\end{equation}

The error function is then defined as the negative log-likelihood, which gives the cross-entropy error function in the form

\begin{equation}
E(w) = - \ln p(t|w) = - \sum\limits_{n = 1}^{N} \left( t_n \ln y_n + (1 - t_n) \ln(1 - y_n) \right)
\end{equation}

Our goal is to learn the weight $w$ such that it minimizes the cross-entropy error function. Due to the nonlinearity of the logistic sigmoid function, there is no closed-form solution to this optimization problem. Fortunately, this error function is concave, and hence has a unique minimum. Moreover, this error function can be minimized by using the Newton-Raphson iterative optimization scheme, which uses a local quadratic approximation to the log likelihood function. The Newton-Raphson update, for minimizing a function $E(w)$, is given as follows:

\begin{equation}
w^{new} = w^{old} - H^{-1} \nabla E(w)
\end{equation}

where $H$ is the Hessian matrix whose entries are the second derivatives of $E(w)$ with respect to the components of $w$. The gradient and Hessian of this error function are given by

\begin{equation}
\nabla E(w) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^{N}(y_n - t_n) \phi_n = \Phi^T(y - t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
H = \nabla \nabla E(w) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^{N} y_n(1 - y_n) \phi_n \phi_n^T = \Phi^T R \Phi
\end{equation}

where we have introduced the $N \times N$ diagonal matrix $R$ with elements

\begin{equation}
R_{nn} = y_n(1 - y_n)
\end{equation}

We see that the Hessian depends on $w$ through the weighting matrix $R$, this is due to the present of the logistic sigmoid function in the error function. The Newton-Raphson update formula for the logistic regression model then becomes

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
w^{new} & = & w^{old} - (\Phi^T R \Phi)^{-1}\Phi^T(y - t)\\
		& = & (\Phi^T R \Phi)^{-1}(\Phi^T R \Phi w^{old} - \Phi^T(y - t))\\
		& = & (\Phi^T R \Phi)^{-1}\Phi^T R z
\end{array}
\label{eq:normal_equations}
\end{equation}

where $z$ is an N-dimensional vector with elements

\begin{equation}
z = \Phi w^{old} - R^{-1}(y - t)
\end{equation}

Because the weighing matrix $R$ is not constant but depends on the parameter vector $w$, we need to apply Equation $\ref{eq:normal_equations}$ iteratively, each time using the new weight vector $w$ to compute a revised weighing matrix $R$. Therefore, this algorithm is known as iterative reweighted least squares, or IRLS.

\subsection{Statistical Shape Model}

To incorporate shape information into the process of segmenting an object in an image, Leventon et al. \cite{leventon2000statistical} introduced a statistical shape model in which a prior on shape variation can be computed based on a set of training instances. Normally a shape is stored in a label image in which each voxel value contains a class label of the shape. However, in active contour models we are interested in modelling the shape boundary rather than the whole shape volume. Therefore, in this case each shape is represented as the zero level set of a signed distance function in a distance map image whose value stores the distance to the boundary of the shape. Nevertheless, for all representations we need $N^d$ samples in a $d$-dimensional image of size $N$ to represent a shape. If we consider each voxel as one dimension, then a shape $u$ is a point in a high dimensional shape space $u \in R^{N^d}$.

Given the training set $T = \left\lbrace u_1, ..., u_n \right\rbrace$, Our goal is to build a shape model over this distribution of surfaces. Since the collection of curves in the training set represent objects of the same class, they are highly correlated thereby introducing large amount of redundancy. The cloud of training points is approximated to have a Gaussian distribution, where most of the dimensions of the Gaussian collapse, leaving the principal modes of shape variation. We can thus reduce redundant dimensions by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which only keeps the most relevant shape variances.

The first step in performing PCA is to subtract the mean shape $\mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum u_i$ from each $u_i$ to create an mean-offset map $\hat{u_i}$. Each $\hat{u_i}$ vector is then placed next to each other as a column in an $N^d \times n$ matrix $M$. After that, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied on the covariance matrix $\frac{1}{n} MM^T$:

\begin{equation}
U \Sigma U^T = \frac{1}{n}MM^T
\end{equation}

where column vectors of the matrix $U$ form a set of orthogonal modes of shape variation and $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix of corresponding singular values. Given a novel shape $u$, we can compress its dimensions by projecting it into the eigen-subspace formed by $k$ principal components corresponding to the first $k$ columns of $U$:

\begin{equation}
\alpha = U^T_k(u - \mu)
\label{eq:eigen}
\end{equation}

where $U_k$ is a projection matrix with $k$ principal components being its columns and $\alpha$ is a vector of coefficients in the $k$-dimensional eigen-subspace. From the coefficients $\alpha$ we can reconstruct an estimate of the shape $u$, namely $\tilde{u}$, by reversing the action in equation $\ref{eq:eigen}$ with some minor loss of information in the least important principal components:

\begin{equation}
\tilde{u} = U_k\alpha + \mu
\end{equation}

Under the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of shape represented by $\alpha$, we can compute the probability of a certain curve as:

\begin{equation}
P(\alpha) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^k |\Sigma_k|}} \exp\left( -\dfrac{1}{2} \alpha^T \Sigma^{-1}_k \alpha \right) 
\end{equation}

where $\Sigma_k$ contains the first $k$ rows and columns of $\Sigma$.

Figure $\ref{fig:shape_training}$ illustrates some training curves used to estimate the shape models of the corpus callosum. The original segmentations are shown as white curves overlaid on the signed-distance map. Figure $\ref{fig:shape_variance}$ shows the means and three primary modes of variance of the shape distribution of the corpus callosum.
