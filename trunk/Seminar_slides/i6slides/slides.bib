  abstract= {Many image segmentation techniques are available in the literature. Some of these techniques use only the gray level histogram, some use spatial details while others use fuzzy set theoretic approaches. Most of these techniques are not suitable for noisy environments. Some works have been done using the Markov Random Field (MRF) model which is robust to noise, but is computationally involved. Neural network architectures which help to get the output in real time because of their parallel processing ability, have also been used for segmentation and they work fine even when the noise level is very high. The literature on color image segmentation is not that rich as it is for gray tone images. This paper critically reviews and summarizes some of these techniques. Attempts have been made to cover both fuzzy and non-fuzzy techniques including color image segmentation and neural network based approaches. Adequate attention is paid to segmentation of range images and magnetic resonance images. It also addresses the issue of quantitative evaluation of segmentation results. },

  abstract= {We present an approach for learning to detect
  objects in still gray images, that is based on a sparse, part-based
  representation of objects. A vocabulary of information-rich object
  parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of
  the object class of interest. Images are then represented using
  parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed
  among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient
  learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the
  object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object
  with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial
  configuration.We report experiments on images of side views of
  cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection
  accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly
  robust to partial occlusion and background variation. In addition,
  we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that
  are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate
  object detection approaches.}

This paper describes a notion of Bayesian sta- tistical similarity and demonstrates how it can be applied to rapid adaptation to new styles. The ability to generalize across different problem instances is illustrated in the Gaussian case, and the use of statistical similarity Gaus- sian case is shown to be related to adaptive metric classi- fication methods. The relationship to prior approaches to multitask learning, as well as variable or adaptive metric classification, and hierarchical Bayesian methods, are dis- cussed. Experimental results on character recognition from the NIST3 database are presented.},
