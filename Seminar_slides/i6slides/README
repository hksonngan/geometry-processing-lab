This latex beamer style was created by Philippe Dreuw and Thomas
Deselaers and should be used for talks presented at the Lehrstuhl fuer
Informatik VI at the RWTH Aachen University.

** Multimedia files 
   All multimedia files should be stored in the folders specifyed
   in \audiodir (default=./audio), \videodir (default=./video), and
   \sourcedir (default=./sources). Use the \renewcommand to change these
   paths.

   [mplayer]
   If you want to have specific setting for a single video file than
   create a mplayer config file, e.g. for video/your_video.avi create a
   file video/your_video.avi.conf with specific settings for mplayer. If
   mplayer is not the default application for the extension '.avi' you
   have to adapt your ~/.mailcap file. Mac users should use Finder to
   choose the default application for their multimedia files.

   [xpdf-viewer only]
   Playing multimedia files simply requests to have a shell script
   with the same name than the multimedia file which will launch the
   appilcation to play that file, e.g. ./video/myVideo.sh should start
   ./video/myVideo.mpg


** Creation of demo slides:
   just type 'make' to create the slides in PDF and PS format.


** Howto to export the slides?
   cvs -d /u/cvs/image export -D now slides


** Too much information?
   Use the file 'template.tex' or 'vortrag_vorlage.tex' to start with 
   an empty slide.


** LaTeX hacks?
   If you want to see the result of the latex hacks on your slides, 
   you have to compile the slides using:
     pdflatex -shell-escape slides.tex
