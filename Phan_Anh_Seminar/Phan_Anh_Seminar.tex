\section{Introduction}

Introduction is written at last.

\section{Image Features}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Image Feature Overview}

What are image features? How can we describe/represent them?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{SURF descriptor}

\cite{bay2006surf}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Edges and Contours}

\subsubsection{Canny Edge Detector}

\subsubsection{Contour Detector}

\cite{maire2008using}

\subsubsection{Shape Descriptor}

\cite{gu2009recognition}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Discussion}

pros and cons. Which descriptor is suitable for a particular case.

\section{Supervised versus Unsupervised Approaches}



\subsection{Supervised Approaches}



\subsubsection{Bag of Visual Words}



\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine}

\subsubsection{Structured SVM learning framework}

\cite{tsochantaridis2006large}

\subsubsection{Statistical Shape Model}

\cite{leventon2000statistical}

\subsection{Unsupervised Approaches}



\section{Graph Construction}

Intuitive connection between graphs and images.

\subsection{Region Graph}

Graph of small over-segmented regions. What is the advantage of this representation compared to branch and bound scheme. MWCS and PCST

\subsection{Contour Graph}

Circulation and Circle Embedding

\subsection{Markov Random Field}

\section{Graph Optimization Algorithms}

comparison of cut algorithms, could them be used interchangeably in different situations.

\subsection{Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree}

\cite{ljubic2006algorithmic}

\subsubsection{Branch-and-Cut Algorithm}

\subsection{Hermitian Eigenvalue Problem}

\subsubsection{Normalized Cut}

\cite{shi2000normalized}

\subsubsection{Contour Cut}

\subsection{Graph-Cut}

\subsubsection{Min-Cut}

\subsubsection{Alpha-Expansion and Fusion Move}

\section{Typical Applications}

System pipeline, result: accuracy, efficiency, benefits.

\subsection{Efficient Region Search for Object Detection}

\cite{VijayGrauman2011}

\subsection{Salient Contour Detection}

\cite{KenGalShi2011}

\subsection{Multi-Shape Graph-Cut for Lung Segmentation}

\cite{nakagomimulti}

\section{Conclusion}

some criticisms e.g. time consuming, dataset used. Recommendation: what to use, why?
