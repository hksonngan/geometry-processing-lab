\section{Image Features}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Image Feature Overview}

What are image features? How can we describe/represent them?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{SURF descriptor}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Edges and Contours}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Discussion}

pros and cons. Which descriptor is suitable for a particular case.

\section{Supervised versus Unsupervised Schemes}



\subsection{Supervised Schemes}



\subsubsection{Bag of Visual Words}



\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine}



\subsubsection{Statistical Shape Model}



\subsection{Unsupervised Schemes}



\section{Graph Construction}

Intuitive connection between graphs and images.

\subsection{Region Graph}

Graph of small over-segmented regions. What is the advantage of this representation compared to branch and bound scheme. MWCS and PCST

\subsection{Contour Graph}

Circulation and Circle Embedding

\subsection{Markov Random Field}

\section{Graph Optimization Algorithms}

comparison of cut algorithms, could them be used interchangeably in different situations.

\subsection{Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree}

\subsection{Hermitian Eigenvalue Problem}

\subsubsection{Normalized Cut}

\subsubsection{Contour Cut}

\subsection{Graph-Cut}

\subsubsection{Min-Cut}

\subsubsection{Alpha-Expansion and Fusion Move}

\section{Typical Applications}

System pipeline, result: accuracy, efficiency, benefits.

\subsection{Efficient Region Search for Object Detection}

\subsection{Salient Contour Detection}

\subsection{Multi-Shape Graph-Cut for Lung Segmentation}

\section{Conclusion}

some criticisms e.g. time consuming, dataset used. Recommendation: what to use, why?
